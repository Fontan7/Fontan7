- 👋 Hi, I’m @Fontan7, I don't push often as I use other git platforms.
- 🖥️ If you see code older than 2 weeks, don't worry I hate it too, its awful, I know.
- 👀 I’m interested in backend, games, and maps creation...
- 🌱 I’m currently: learning data engineering, and a side project...
- 💔 Not available to collaborate at the time...
